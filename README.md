## 🕵️‍♂️ **About Me**
- 🔓 **Interests:** Red teaming, penetration testing, and exploring the depths of ethical hacking.
- 🌐 **Current Focus:**
  - **Web Hacking:** Mastering the art of exploiting web vulnerabilities (and maybe a heart or two along the way). 😉
  - **Network Security:** Securing and breaching networks to uncover weaknesses... and maybe find a connection worth protecting. 🔐
  - **Scripting & Automation:** Crafting tools in **Go**, **Python**, and **Bash** to streamline hacking workflows (and maybe write a love letter or two in code). 💌
- 🛠️ **Looking to Join:** Seeking a skilled, discreet, and elite underground hacking team to collaborate on high-stakes projects... or maybe just someone to share a cup of coffee with while debugging code. ☕
